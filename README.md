## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).
- Run the development web server using the `node express_server.js` command.
- Open a browser (ie chrome) and navigate to http://localhost:8080/. It will redirect you to a login page--click "register" in the upper right hand corner and fill in the form with your email address and password. If you miss either of those, or use an invalid email address, you will be prompted to try again.

### if you want to edit a long url, click "edit". It will take you to that url's individual page. The individual page also contains analytics such as views, unique views, timestamps of views, and date created. All are reset when url is edited.

### users cannot access the individual pages for short urls that are not associated with their accounts.
